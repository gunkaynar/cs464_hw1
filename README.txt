All programs in the Homework folder were coded and tested in Python 3.9.5.Conda environment was utilized and Spyder was used as IDE.All programs work in terminal, but for the convenience of the grader, a graphic IDE is recommended because no csv file output is given. All the predictions are returned in arrays.All programs require the datasets in their folder. Please consider using the folders as is.The dependencies are:* Numpy* Pandas* Time* Math* Copy/HWML/q2/a/main.py is the answer for 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4./HWML/q2/b/main.py is the answer for 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4. Native Python without numpy and pandas is used for this task because the time difference could not be calculated since it was too fast. Please do not forget to include load_data.py in the same folder./HWML/q3/main.py is the answer for 3.1 and 3.2./HWML/q3/main2.py is the answer for 3.3. All programs are ready to execute. No parameter is needed. Every training, test, calculation and measurements are done by default. If you desire to get the predicted labels for any of the programs above, after executing the program by “python main.py”, you should command “predicted_labels” to terminal. It will return a numpy array or a native array to you depending on the program. The accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores are already printed after the execution of the program. If you would like to see the confusion matrix, please make scores function return those values by modifying. I have not included these variables in printing out for the convenience of the user.
